                <p class="p-white">Nice to meet you. My name is Lydia Stone, I am a data engineer, and I love good answers.<br><br>

                    From blowing the test curve, to researching nutrition, reading lists, parenting philosophies, and even garden soil development, my whole life I have counted on turning the numbers into success.<br><br>

                    Growing up on a New Mexico wool farm with a family yarn shop I knew fiber and fabric. I set my sights higher. My family asked “College?” My friends asked “Where?” and my educators asked “Why this, farm-girl?”<br><br>

                    Reading every fashion book at my county library turned up answers. Many were written by professors from the Fashion Institute of Technology, or referred to their costume library. Running the stats required no genius, but I did need ingenuity! According to the numbers -my bank account- I had the money to apply to only one school, where the fashion design major accepted 2% of the applicants. Less, for mail-in portfolios like mine.<br><br>
                    Han Solo was wrong. Tell me the odds so I can game them!
                    I loved FIT and New York City. Hard work with likeminded peers was a dream and I graduated with highest honors. My designs have featured in NY Fashion Week, on TV, and in stores like Kohls, and Walmart. But this isn’t a fashion story.<br><br>

                    I calculated again, this time for love, marrying my sweetheart, a water engineer. Delaware, however, is known for business and banking, not fashion. Undaunted, I returned to my entrepreneurial roots: I consulted long-distance under NDAs for years while my kids grew. I supplemented with a blog where I learned about web development and SEO, I gigged, and I did custom sewing, but it was not adding up.<br><br>

                    When it was time to run the numbers on a new direction, data science called to me. My family asked “In those shoes?” My friends asked “How?” and my educators asked “Why this, fancy-pants?”<br><br>

                    With more info available then ever, data science<br>
                    -Strives to ask the right questions and find good answers.<br>
                    -Rewards independent learners who stay on top of the tech.<br>
                    -Offers detail-oriented challenge.<br>
                    -Requires excellent communication skills.<br><br>

                    My whole life had been preparing me for this, I just needed to branch out my tech skills.<br><br>

                    This time my research led me to Zip Code Wilmington, a highly rated in-person coding academy with a super-exclusive acceptance procedure. So I traded my signature red lipstick for something more muted, put my head down, and studied. Again, I was accepted!<br><br>

                    My self-discipline paid off. I have found a passion for whipping dirty data into shape, a proclivity for Agile methodologies, and some projects I am proud of.<br><br>

                    Regardless of the field, my through-line is striving for the best answer to the most important question.<br><br>

                    Now, I am excited to work with a team that loves solving problems and helping people. In fashion I made products people can wear. Now, I want to work on projects that make a difference in people's lives. I can’t wait to use my data science and engineering skills to help your business team!
