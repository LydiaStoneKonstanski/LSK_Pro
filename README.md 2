## Changes in 2020

I had to make a bunch of changes in this code to get it running. Took far longer than it should.
But now, if I have it right, you need to clone this and then

This currently puts a sqlite3 db in the /tmp directory.

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ ./run.sh
```

and it should appear on port 5000

`http://localhost:5000`

## Changes in 2023

database is now in `instance/` directory
removed version labels from `requirements.txt`

The Heroku file is broken.
The Procfile is broken too.

## Changes in 2024

Procfile is fixed.
